# Biofeedback
This project is a prototype biofeedback suite for the purposes of delivering real-time feedback of various biosensor data using:
## 1. Visual feedback in the form of bar meters and graphs
## 2. Haptic feedback in the form of vibration alerts delivered using vibration motors controlled via Arduino
